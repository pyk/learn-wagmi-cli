# Learn wagmi CLI

This is my personal note on `wagmi(1)`:

-   If you need something like typechain but for viem, you are wrong. viem can
    be type inferred without build step.
-   You can use wagmi cli to automatically download ABI from etherscan but it's
    overkill unless you are using React or something.
